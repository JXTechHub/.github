## 🙋‍♀️ Introduction

The purpose of this personal organization is to design and build applications that adhere to good software architecture practices across different programming languages.

**Note: Still a work in progress~**

## 👩‍ Background
Every now and then, I tend to forget these basic concepts and have to constantly "google" to refresh my memory. As an
undergraduate student studying software engineering, I felt that having a strong understanding of these concepts and being able to apply them in practice are key ingredients in being a good programmer.

As this organization grows, I believe it will be helpful to people and others who are interested in learning and improving themselves continuously.
